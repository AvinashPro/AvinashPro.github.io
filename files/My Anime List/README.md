## Purpose
The purpose of this readme is to get you to understand how to use **personal mode** of MAL.

## Personal Mode 
In _personal mode_ you can add and manage your own anime list. But you need to remember that this data is saved locally in your browser.

To enable it, visit navigation bar and turn on _Personal Mode_.

### Must read 
I strongly recommend you to make backup(export) of your list every single time you make changes. That's because the data is stored in local storage of your browser. You can import your data whenever you like. Note: Import option replaces the old data with the new data rather than adding the new data to the old one.

### Add new anime 
Click on _add_ button next to the "Add new anime" text. Note: All fields are mandatory. Below is the brief detail about them.

##### Index: Index represents the order of your anime. For a movie, add _M_ prefix to index as in _M1_ or _M5_.

##### Name: Here goes name of the anime.

##### Episodes: Here goes episodes count.

##### Cover URL: Here goes the link of the image you want as a cover in the anime card. Use any image you like from google or from any other online source. Image should be in portrait dimension.

##### Aired: Here goes Aired date. You can set it to like "2019" or "2013-2020" or "September 2020 to October 2023". You can also add string and your short notes or status in it. It accepts any string value.

##### Watched: This field requires Month name and year, however, year is optional. Possible month names are _January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November and December_ (case sensitive). For instance _"May 2021"_, _"13 August 2010"_, _"14 February 2013 - 14 November 2013"_ and so on.

##### Main: It is checked by default. Uncheck it to save the anime in the _ecchi_ list.



### Edit details
Double click on anime card then click on _Edit_ button. You should be able to edit details however you like.

### Delete anime from the list
Double click on anime card then click on _Delete_ button. This cannot be undone.

### Password
It is _Purple_ (case sensitive). I've added it so that you can hide your ecchi anime list from your non-programmar friends. Once you've entered the password it will be saved on your browser's local storage so that you won't need to enter the password every single time you visit. 
You can reset it, of course. Just type **\pass** in search bar. It'll delete password from your browser's local storage and you'd need to enter the password the next time you visit.

### Some Tips
To enlarge an image of an anime card just click on the image. After that, clicking on caption will redirect you to google page of that anime.

To view main and ecchi anime **simultaneously**, turn on ecchi checkbox then type any gibberish in the search bar like "wdj". Now delete the gibberish that you wrote in the search bar letter by letter. TADA! Now you should be able to view both list simultaneously. (What a convenient bug(or feature? lol)!)

I'd recommend you to not to rely on this crappy piece of code. You can edit JSON file in any text editor and import the JSON file thereafter.

### _new-password_\pass 
To change the current password, type the new password followed by _\pass_ in the anime search bar.

### \default\pass 
To set the password to default password, type _\default\pass_ in the anime search bar.

### \reset [WARNING]
Use _\reset_ command in the anime search bar to **DELETE** all the data from browser. It will permanently delete your data from your browser; Always make a backup of the data to prevent the lose of data.

### \blue 
If you want to go back to my list. Enter _\blue_ command in search bar.
